A prime number is a number that can be evenly divided by only itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is a prime number because it can be evenly divided by only 1 and 5.The number 6, however, is not prime because it can be evenly divided by 1, 2, 3, and 6. Write a Boolean function named IsPrimethat takes an integer as an argument and returns true if the argument is a prime number and false otherwise. Use this function to display all the prime numbers from 1 to 100 in a list box. The program should have a loop that calls the IsPrimefunction.Remember that the % operator divides one number by another and returns the remainder of the division. In an expression such as num1 % num2, the % operator returns 0 if num1 is evenly divisible by num2
